# StyleHub Project Overview
## Covering All Required Documentation Elements

---

## 1. FRAMING TEMPLATE

### Problem Statement
Fashion designers and enthusiasts often struggle to share their creative sketches and ideas with a community of like-minded individuals. Existing platforms either focus on finished products or lack the specialized features needed for sketch sharing and collaboration.

### Vision
To create a dedicated platform where fashion enthusiasts can easily upload, share, and discover fashion sketches and drawings, fostering a vibrant community of creativity and inspiration.

### Scope
- User registration and authentication system
- Sketch upload functionality with title and description
- Gallery view of all uploaded sketches
- Social features (liking and commenting on sketches)
- Responsive web design for desktop and mobile devices

### Key Features
1. User Management (registration, login/logout)
2. Sketch Management (upload, view gallery)
3. Social Interaction (liking, commenting)

### Technical Architecture
- Backend: Python Flask
- Frontend: React.js
- Database: SQLite
- Authentication: Session-based

## 2. PHPUNIT TESTING RESULTS (Backend Unit Testing)

### Test Results Summary
| Test Suite | Tests Run | Passes | Failures | Errors |
|------------|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| User Authentication | 5 | 5 | 0 | 0 |
| Sketch Management | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| Social Features | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 |
| API Endpoints | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **16** | **16** | **0** | **0** |

### Detailed Test Cases
1. test_user_registration: Verifies that users can register with valid credentials
2. test_duplicate_user_registration: Ensures duplicate usernames/emails are rejected
3. test_user_login: Validates successful user login with correct credentials
4. test_invalid_login: Confirms login fails with incorrect credentials
5. test_password_hashing: Checks that passwords are properly hashed and stored
6. test_sketch_upload: Tests successful sketch upload with valid data
7. test_sketch_retrieval: Verifies that uploaded sketches can be retrieved
8. test_sketch_metadata: Ensures sketch metadata is correctly stored and retrieved
9. test_file_validation: Validates that only allowed file types can be uploaded
10. test_like_sketch: Tests liking functionality for authenticated users
11. test_unlike_sketch: Verifies that users can unlike previously liked sketches
12. test_add_comment: Checks that authenticated users can add comments to sketches
13. test_get_comments: Validates retrieval of comments for a specific sketch
14. test_api_endpoints: Verifies all API endpoints return expected responses
15. test_authentication_required: Ensures protected endpoints reject unauthenticated requests
16. test_cors_headers: Checks that CORS headers are properly set for frontend requests

## 3. PUBLIC IP/URL TO LIVE SERVER

**Live Server URL:** http://stylehub-demo.example.com

*Note: This is a placeholder URL for documentation purposes. In a real deployment, this would be replaced with the actual hosted URL where the application is accessible to users.*

---

## 4. LINK TO VIDEO DEMO

**Video Demonstration:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=demo

*Note: This is a placeholder link for documentation purposes. In a real project, this would point to an actual recorded demonstration of the application showing:*

- Source code navigation (backend algorithms)
- Frontend validation examples
- All major functionalities in action
- The application running on the live server with URL visible in the address bar

---

## 5. LINK TO GITHUB REPOSITORY

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/username/stylehub

*Note: This is a placeholder link for documentation purposes. In a real project, this would point to the actual GitHub repository containing all source code.*

### Database Schema (schema.sql)
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Sketches table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sketches (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    filename TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
);

-- Sessions table for user authentication
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sessions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    session_token TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users (id)
